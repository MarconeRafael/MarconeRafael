# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello! My name is Marcone Rafael, and I'm a technology enthusiast passionate about Artificial Intelligence. ðŸš€

ðŸŽ“ I have a technical background in Informatics from IFRN, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at UFRN.

ðŸ’¡ Throughout my academic journey, I have been involved in academic projects since 2019, and I have had the opportunity to learn various skills, including C, Pandas, Machine Learning, Data Science, Computational Modeling and Simulation, and Deep Neural Networks.

ðŸ”§ Recently, I started working as a technical support scholar at UFRN, where I have the opportunity to further enhance my skills in Python, MySQL, Django, JavaScript, React, CSS, and HTML through real-world projects.

ðŸŒŸ In addition to Artificial Intelligence, I am also interested in Web Development, Machine Learning, and Data Science, always seeking to expand my knowledge in these areas.

âš¡ Outside the world of technology, I practice Luta Sanda and regularly go to the gym, aiming to achieve a balance between mind and body.

ðŸ“¬ Feel free to reach out to me via email at marconerafael6@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn: [Marcone Rafael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marconerafael/).

Let's create something amazing together! âœ¨
